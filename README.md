## Getting Started
Prompts are generated from the examples.csv, interface.csv, and words.csv files in each `prompts` folder. 

To create a new prompt, add a new folder to the `prompts` folder (e.g `prompts/custom`) and populate with the required .csv files. 

Finally, add your new folder name to the `prompts/index.js` registry.
